#Portfolio Website

This will be a continual work in progress.

**About**

Using react I'm building a personal website. The website has the feel of a desktop in a browser, with a start menu, "desktop" icons, and windows that popup.
The site uses states to determine which window to display and what the contents of the windows will contain once opened and interacted with.
